# LTP.Interop.OpenGL
Low-level .NET bindings for OpenGL Core and GLFW, for use with LTP.Interop
 
For the **LTP.Interop.OpenGL.ExampleWindow** project to work, please place the GLFW3 binary in the working directory, or subdirectory thereof. Installing the binary globally into a system path should also work. Pre-compiled binaries may be obtained from [the official download page](https://www.glfw.org/download.html).
